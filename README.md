# My custom implementation of Jeff Geerling Airgradient Monitor System

This is my personal fork of Jeffs awesome implementation of Airgradients monitor system. I've tweaked the time it goes around querying the sensors and added a display clock for the "wife approval factor".

It also disables the LCD backlight between 7pm and 9am.

If you're going to fork this, please credit Jeff.
