/**
 * This sketch connects an AirGradient DIY sensor to a WiFi network, and runs a
 * tiny HTTP server to serve air quality metrics to Prometheus.
 * 
 * This will be an upgrade to the existing code base and a complete re-write.
 * The plan is to add the ability to adjust the time offset automatically as well as 
 * access a web page allowing the user to adjust the sensors offset.
